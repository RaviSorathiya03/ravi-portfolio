## 🔮 The Experience

Welcome to my portfolio! This isn't just a resume; it's an interactive journey. I've crafted a space that feels alive, using the power of **React Three Fiber** and **GSAP** to bring 3D elements and smooth animations to the web.

### 🍱 Standard 3D Asset
You can view the raw 3D model used in the immersive scene directly on GitHub:
